# Mobile Game Funnel & Monetization Analysis

This project analyzes a simulated mobile game funnel to evaluate user progression, engagement, and monetization behavior.

---

## 📊 Funnel Metrics

- Tutorial Conversion: 85%
- Level 1 Completion: 70%
- First Purchase Conversion: 16%

---

## 💰 Revenue Metrics

- ARPU: 3.39  
- ARPPU: 20.91  

Revenue distribution is strongly right-skewed, indicating that a small segment of users drives a disproportionate share of total revenue.

## 🔎 Segment-Based Insights

Segment analysis reveals:

- All paying users completed early progression stages.
- Non-paying users show significant drop-off before purchase stages.
- Early engagement is strongly correlated with monetization potential.

This suggests that optimizing tutorial flow and early progression could significantly improve overall revenue performance.
